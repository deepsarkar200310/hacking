my wives:

python(most prettiest

my home:
linux(parrot os ....used to think kali os is smoothest)

commands used in linux terminal:
open file manager or home in linux operating system

now ill tell you command to do so using terminal
pwd:to know your location
ls: to list everything around you
cd:to change your location
cd ..:to go back to your previous location
