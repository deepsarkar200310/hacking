# hacking

I was always fascinated by haking since childhood dropped it due to my board exams right now I'm in college and thought of giving it a try so lets start


my wives:
c++(difficult but rocks when together)
python(most prettiest

my home:
linux(parrot os ....used to think kali os is smoothest)

some of you might be thinking of a new laptop with linuxx, some thinking baout installing linux in virtual env....best will be modern prob require modern sol üò§ so use internet and just type linux terminal for free..... linux helps a lot why specifially linux beacuse its simple , opensourse means there are many homo sapiens whorking hard for expressing thie idea over linux kernal for us hoomans ...basicly there are lots of free extremely capable resources

it helps

give prefrence to learning commands ..... start from wen computers were born. no its not a history class

commands used in linux terminal:
open file manager or home in linux operating system

now ill tell you command to do so using terminal
pwd:to know your location
ls: to list everything around you
cd:to change your location
cd ..:to go back to your previous location


in linux all you settings conf your ip addrs i saved as files 

this gives you super powers seriously think about it .... you have the ability to manipulate even the slighest of thing in you computer software

and rm is a command remover
