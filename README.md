# hacking


i was very interested in hacking since childhood I lost interest eventually while preparing for my boards exam I am in college right now thought of giving it a try so let's start:

two wives:
c++(difficult but she rocks we are together)
python(most prettiest)

my home:
Linux(parrot os preferably but sometimes i think of purchasing my neighbours house i.e. kali )
